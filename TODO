# TODO

0. being able to print tuples will actually speed up debugging so we
   should wire things up. (also make sure all types have a printer)

1. lots of more built in types (double/float/signed ints)

2. more unit tests, especially the early stuff that don't really have
   any but are actually foundational like byte_array.

3. complete hashtree.c

4. make hashtable simply an array of hashtrees hence no need to deal
   with chaining!
