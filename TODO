# TODO

1. make it easy to use Boehm garbage collector. make it possible to
   use other allocators such as an arena allocator (possibly even
   write a simple arena allocator).
2. all "maps" should take values as keys plus a key type descriptor to
   provide compare, equal, and append to buffer.
3. all "maps" etc. should be "printable" to byte buffers (which can
   then be turned into strigs)
