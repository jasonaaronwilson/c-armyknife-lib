# TODO

1. lots of more built in types (double/float/signed ints)
2. more unit tests, especially the early stuff that don't really have
   any but are actually foundational like byte_array.
3. complete hashtree.c (after reflecting on how to do self pointers
   better and in fact all recursive types...)
