/**
 * This is a single header file C library providing a small set of
 * critical functions on existing C data-structures as well as a few
 * critical collections like hashtables. This library only depends on
 * the C standard library (and probably some POSIX functions).
 *
 * At least one ".c" file in your project must include
 * c-armyknife-lib.h after defining C_ARMYKNIFE_LIB_IMPL which
 * provides the definitions of the code and data rather than just
 * prototypes, inlined functions, macros, and type definitions.
